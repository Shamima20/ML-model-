#  Employee Turnover Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses classification techniques to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company. Designed to help HR teams make proactive decisions using data-driven insights.

##  Problem Statement

High attrition rates lead to increased costs and organizational disruption. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify which employees are at risk of leaving, based on various features like job satisfaction, salary, work experience, etc.

##  Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Project Structure

- `Machine_Learning_Employee_Turnover.ipynb`: Main analysis and modeling notebook
- `data/`: Dataset used for model training
- `images/`: Optional charts/visuals
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

##  Key Highlights

- Data preprocessing, EDA, and feature engineering
- Multiple classification models tested (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Final model chosen based on accuracy and recall
- Model explains key factors influencing turnover, with visual insights

##  Insights

- Job satisfaction and number of projects strongly influence turnover
- Employees with lower average monthly hours and high time spent in company are at higher risk
